General flow for model calibration
0. In the very beginning, please create your own branch and update the model and input folder
1. Summarize target values from survey data
2. Go to the corresponding calibration class and implement the code
3. Go to the corresponding model class and do the following task:
    3.1 Add a map to store the calibration factors on the fly
    3.2 Add a boolean variable to let model being able to distinguish between a usual model run or calibration run
    3.3 Add a new constructor to initialize the above-mentioned variables
    3.4 Update the coefficients table
    3.5 Update the utility calculation
    3.6 Add a new method "updateCalibrationFactor" to contain the calibration factors in each iteration
    3.7 Add a new method "obtainCoefficientsTable"
4. Build the project to check any compile error
5. Commit your code and input file accordingly with understandable message
6. Open pull request and merge to the master
